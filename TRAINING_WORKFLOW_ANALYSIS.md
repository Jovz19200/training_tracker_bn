# Training Management System - Complete Workflow Analysis

## üéØ System Overview

The Training Management System consists of 6 core components that work together to manage the complete training lifecycle:

1. **Training Requests** - Initial training requests and approvals
2. **Courses** - Training course definitions and management
3. **Enrollments** - Student enrollment in courses
4. **Schedules** - Course session scheduling and management
5. **Attendance** - Session attendance tracking
6. **Resources** - Training resources (rooms, equipment, materials)
